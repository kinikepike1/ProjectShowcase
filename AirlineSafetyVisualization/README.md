# Airline Safety Visualization and Data Summary
## Overview

This project was a requirements for Bellevue University's Data Presentation and Visualization course. The data used was open source airline safety information (included).

## Infographic

Designed to bring attention to the increase in flyers within the last ten years. Shows the industry is growing and to later illustrate that despite this, air travel is still extremely safe. Second section shows how uncommon it is for an individual to experience a plane incident and how even less likely it is for that incident to be fatal. The pie graph used for this section has a section much larger than 0.0006 but it was nearly imperceivable so it's size was increased to 0.0025. The last section is to further illustrate the safety of air travel while also comparing it to road travel. 

## Dashboard

Various graphs and charts that help in understanding and presenting the data in question.
