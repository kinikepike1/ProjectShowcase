# Magic the Gathering Mana Cost Analysis

## Overview

Magic the Gathering (MtG) is a collectable card game in which most cards have a resource requirement to play, this resource is known as mana. There are multiple type of mana within MtG that are denoted by their specific color. Converted mana cost (CMC) ignores the specificity of mana color requirements and simplifies total mana requirement to a single number. This project was designed to find trends in cards that may inform CMC.

## Analysis

Card effects, power, and toughness were used in this analysis via linear regression.
